    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight</br> 
       language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be </br>
       connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>
       <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set</br> 
          of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript</br>
          can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a </br>
              browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions </br>
              allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events</br>
               such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to</br>
              running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an</br>
             application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from</br>
             one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
           </ul>

    <header>Why should you already know</header>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the</br>
            tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Javascript_and_Java">
    <header>Javascript_and_Java</header>
    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The</br>
       JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type</br>
       checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic</br>
       control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</br>
    </p>
    <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a</br>
       runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and</br> 
       string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common</br>
       class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,</br>
       what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any</br>
       special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely</br>
       typed methods.
    </p>
      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all</br>
         variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods</br>
         are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,</br>
         parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
    </p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Hello world">
    <header>Hello world</header>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
       JavaScript code:
    </p>
    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</br>
        greetMe("World");
       </code>
        <p>     Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        </p>

</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>     You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,</br>
            called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
   </p>
   <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent </br>
       characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the</br> 
       characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
       <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use</br>
       the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names</br>
       are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
    </p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Declaring variables">
    <header>Declaring variables</header>
    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
    </p>
     <p>With the keyword var. For example,
    </p>
    <code>var x = 42.</code>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
    </p></br>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
    </p>
    <code>x = 42.</code>
    <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
    <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
    <code>let y = 13.</code>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Global variable">
    <header>Global variable</header>
    <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,</br>  
       so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
    </p>
    <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or</br> 
       frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared</br> 
       in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header>constants</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant</br>
           identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar</br> 
           sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is</br> 
           running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const</br> 
           keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.</br> 
           For example:
        </p>
        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL</br>
            CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
            }
        </code>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without</br> 
               problems.</p>
                
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data type">
        <header>Data type</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                <ul>
               <li>Boolean. true and false.<li>
                   <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                </br>  case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
               <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
               <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
               <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
               <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful </br> 
               functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in  </br>
               the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as </br>
               procedures that your application can perform.
            </p>
       
    </section>
    
    <section class="main-section" id="Function declarations">
       <header>Function declarations</header>
       <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the 
    </br>function keyword, followed by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
        </li>
    </ul>
       <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
       <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement</br>
         that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return </br>
         statement specifies the value returned by the function.
    </p>
    <code>return number * number;</code>
    <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed</br> 
        to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not</br>
         reflected globally or in the calling function.
